# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes is a project that shows Brazilian daily recipes known by me.

Throughout this project I aim to showcase the skills learned by now with Odin Project at HTML.

By the end of it, I expect to have a proper understanding of what I've learned and what I need to still review and get the hang of.
